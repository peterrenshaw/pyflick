 My quick hack to get images from my machine to flickr
 adding some metadata along the way.


   ./upload.py       -i $HOME/work/flickr/2019/2019SEP/2019SEP21/u1/*.png 
                     -t "bootload 2019 2019SEP 2019SEP21 climate change climatestrip australia temperatures temp hot data warmingstripe 1901 2018"
                     -d "Warming Stripes for #Australia from 1901-2018 Using data from Berkeley Earth. #ShowYourStripes"

* a typical usage pattern

a) files dumped into a directory

   /2019/2019SEP/2019SEPXX/d

  d is a download directory and has multiple large files in it.

b) process files in download directory

  files are:

     resized
     modified for white balance
     renamed
     placed in ../u/ directory

c) uploaded using pyflick
- todays upload for example:

   python3 upload.py -i $HOME/work/flickr/2019/2019SEP/2019SEP05/u1/*.jpg 
                     -d "Doing stuff in the last week of winter. Planting." 
                     -t "bootload 2019 2019SEP 2019SEP05 spring planting outside"

   ./upload.py       -i $HOME/work/flickr/2019/2019SEP/2019SEP21/u1/*.png 
                     -t "bootload 2019 2019SEP 2019SEP21 climate change climatestrip australia temperatures temp hot data warmingstripe 1901 2018"
                     -d "Warming Stripes for #Australia from 1901-2018 Using data from Berkeley Earth. #ShowYourStripes"
